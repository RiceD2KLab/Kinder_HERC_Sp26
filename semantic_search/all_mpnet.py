"""
The skeleton code for this is from the SBERT documentation found here: https://www.sbert.net/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/semantic-search/README.html#symmetric-vs-asymmetric-semantic-search
This is a simple application for sentence embeddings: semantic search

We have a corpus with various sentences. Then, for a given query sentence,
we want to find the most similar sentence in this corpus.

This script outputs for various queries the top 5 most similar sentences in the corpus.
